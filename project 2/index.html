            <h3 class="text-animation">I Have <span></span></h3>
            <p>I'm Killua Zoldyck, from the famous Zoldyck family of assassins.
                Trained to kill since I was six, I know how to take down enemies without hesitation.
                But that life, Not for me. When I met Gon he gave me a taste of life.
                Sure, I’m fast, strong, and can even use electricity to power up my skills, but I’m more than just a killer.
                I’ve got my own sense of right and wrong, and I’ll do anything to protect the people I care about.
                My friends mean more to me than anything.
            </p>

                        <h3>Hunter Exam</h3>
                        <p>Honestly, it was kinda boring. I only took it to see what all the fuss was about, 
                            but most of the people there were weak. The challenges? They didn’t really push me.
                             I’ve been trained as an assassin my whole life, so nothing there was a real threat.
                              The best part was meeting Gon, he’s strong in ways he doesn’t even realize yet, and that got my attention.
                            As for the exam itself, I didn’t really care about the rules. If I wanted to pass, I could’ve done it easily,
                             but things got messy near the end... maybe I just wasn’t interested in being a Hunter after all.
                        </p>

                    <div class="timeline-content">
                        <h3>Heavens Arena</h3>
                        <p>Now that was a blast. Way better than the Hunter Exam. It’s just me, fighting my way to the top,
                            floor by floor. Most of the fighters didn’t even stand a chance—too weak. 
                            I blew through the lower floors without breaking a sweat.
                            But when I learned about Nen? That’s when things got real. It wasn’t just about strength anymore;
                            it was about technique. Once I got the hang of Nen, 
                            those so-called “strong” fighters didn’t know what hit them.
                            The higher floors had some tough guys, but that’s what made it fun.
                            I finally got to push myself and see how far I could go.

                        <h3>Greed Island</h3>
                        <p>That was something else. A real-life game where everything could kill you? Sounds perfect,
                            right? I mean, the challenges were tough, but I like tough. The game was full of surprises—monsters, 
                            crazy players, dangerous spells—but that’s what made it fun.
                            What really made Greed Island interesting was how it wasn’t just about fighting. It was about using strategy,
                            collecting cards, and knowing when to make your move. Of course, with my abilities, 
                            the fighting part wasn’t much of a problem, but working with Gon and the others?
                            It felt like we were unstoppable. 
                            Plus, I got to level up my Nen even more, which made things way easier. Honestly,
                            Greed Island was like the ultimate training ground. We learned a lot,
                            but let’s be real—I was always ahead of the game.

                            <h3>Chimera Ant</h3>
                            <p>That was a nightmare. I’ve never seen anything like them before. Those monsters were brutal,
                                stronger than almost anything we’d faced. It wasn’t just a fight for survival—it was like staring death 
                                in the face every time. The worst part was watching Gon change through it all. He got darker,
                                more desperate, especially after what happened to Kite.
                                I did everything I could to help him, but honestly, even I was scared. 
                                Those ants were no joke, and the Royal Guard... they were on a whole different level.
                                I had to keep Gon from losing himself completely, but it was hard. That whole time,
                                it felt like we were teetering on the edge of something we couldn’t come back from.
